Open Source KTP Checker + KYC

This repository contain the lookup data for mapping the KTP into Location.
This data requires a lot of time to make it.
And the logic is in the `kuaci.py`.

If you want to try the google search engine API,
please make one from here: [https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest].
You have to pass the key in the search function.

All of this made using python 3.6.7.
Requirements: [here](requirements.txt)

This my first time trying to create an open source :)
Please be kind.
